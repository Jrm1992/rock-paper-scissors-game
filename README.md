## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

### Extra challenges

As an extra challenge I will do the following things:

- Add smooth animations to make it feel more like a game.
- Also add a computer score to make the game more interesting.
- Be able to reset the scores (which state I maintain using `localStorage`)
- Make the game accessible according to WCAG 2.1 standards, things like color contrast, clear element focus and the correct screen reader contexts.
